  ## Introduction

   This was an e-commerce project I completed to further my understanding of React. I used redux to control global state for a seamless shopping experience.

  ## Technologies

  - Javascript
  - React
  - Redux
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Router V6
  - XML


  ## Features

  This application fetches shopping data from an api and displays the data in organized rows. This application allows users to add, and remove items they're interested in to a shopping cart. It also uses Router for a multi-page experience.

  ## Possible Future Extensions

  Future extensions that i would like to implement are a login page and a search bar giving users the ability to further interact with the data.

  ## Set Up
  1. Fork and clone this repo.
  2. Type `cd` to move into the root directory.
  3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. Have Fun!
